  <h3> Cyber Security </h3>
  <body>
  There has always been a demand for security due to the ever growing I.T. industry. Every company that has an information system has always some form of security in place. Whether it is small business with basic Antivirus software in place of a few machines, or larger companies that have small and large teams looking after databases, customer personal information stored on servers. The security of looking after this information is continuously growing as more and more businesses are aware of the importance of keeping data safe from invasive people. 

Cyber Security is in a high demand as businesses are understanding the importance of keeping digital data safe.

The below graph shows the increasing market size in the U.S. for cyber security for now and beyond. Cloud based and network security is always in high demand as the number of users of cloud based services are increasing due to the ease of the service and high security in storing data on a cloud.

    The skills required for Cyber Security and Cryptographers required very specific skills around the maintenance and patching of security data to ensure the safety of data and no hostile breaches to personal data and offer protection to the users that store information on their servers. 

Skills like these are needed to ensure the upkeep on the service involved - Problem solving, programming know-how, risk analysis, strong communication skills, abilities to make decisions in problem solving, critical thinking are essential in these job roles. Employers look for these skills as the ability to work effectively in a team.

 <h3> <b> How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?  </b> </h3>
  
  Communication is essential for any successful team work needed to understand the tasks involved, improve accuracy in their work and can often give higher motivation and encourage team members to add input. Problem solving skills are key in security to give the user and the team a better chance to create better algorithms and ciphers to help keep data secure and to resolve future escalations.

  <h3> <b> What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set? </b> </h3>
  
  Coding and programming appears to be the highest when looking at IT related skills for security related jobs. 
    
    
     <h4> -Project Management </h4>
     <h4> -Building Relationships </h4>
     <h4> -Business Management </h4>
     
      <h3> <b> What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set? </h3> </b>
      
     These skills highlighted are seen as least concern in security or low preference when working in this field. Whilst communication ranks highly, it is also one that is most important when working in a team. Teamwork ranks highly in security as there are teams of people involved to write and develop code around security and communication to keep everyone aligned on tasks.
Mentoring does help in some long term aspects but the role involved in security is usually learned through the users knowledge around the specific areas in that field. 

Followed by creativity, code in security can be general by using simple and complex algorithms to piece together data that will help maintain and stabilise a network or cloud based service. Creativity can help make new lines of code that can help certain situations when or if there is a breach in a piece of security and often not making something to help create or compile strings of data to improve or fix something that needs to be resolved urgently. 

Leadership can help motivate a team if team morale is low, guidance on certain issues, shadowing tasks for feedback, and working on personal goals.

    <h3> <b> Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not? </h3> </b>
    The importance of security in the always growing I.T. Industry is extremely important when factoring in frequent malicious attacks on data systems and hacking of cloud based servers. 
Digital security is always in high demand and is continuously growing. Looking back at Top Generic Skills at Burning Glass data, problem solving ranks highly as a skill that is required for security jobs. 

The above graphs displayed shows that Cyber Security requires a highly level of Information Security which is the safety of encrypted data and the protection around it. Whilst the opinion of my ideal job has not changed, looking at similar related job roles like Systems Engineer has similar skills such as monitoring, configuring, testing and maintenance of systems, do come close to the tasks involved with security related work.

  <b> <h3> What kind of work is done by the IT professional? </h3> </b>
  An IT professional completes an array of tasks all requiring different methods and software choices. IT work involves knowing a plethora of programming languages that relate to various softwares. For example, Oracle, SQL and C++ may be the languages needed for one role. The work completed daily involves interconnecting job roles well in order to achieve a common objective as a team. Projects are created and must be complete as a team in order to go live by the due date without errors. Working together is definitely one of the most vital part of IT work. 
  
  
  
  <b> <h3> What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they IT professionals? </h3> </b>
  There are various people interacting with IT professionals. Most importantly, the team leader. However, there are instances that involve working with finance teams and marketing teams in order to help achieve a common objective for the company. It is important to be able to interact with all departments as computers and softwares are used non stop to run a company.
  
  
  
<b> <h3>  Where does the IT professional spend most of their time? </h3> </b>
An IT professional does spend most of his or her time at the desk, on the computer. Most IT roles do involve continuous analysis using the computer and programming is always done via a computer.



<b> <h3> What aspect of their position is most challenging? </h3> </b>
One of the most challenging parts of their roles is within the programming side of work. In particular, the errors. When code is written incorrectly, the error comes up at launch – when you run the code. Therefore, you are looking for the error and it is rigorous work to be able to find some buried within thousands of lines of code.

  <b> <h2> Project Ideas </h2> </b>
  <center> <h4> Scholar </h4> </center>
  <body>
  Scholar is Australia’s online tutorial community, bridging the worlds of students and educators.  Whether an individual is a qualified teacher, a mentor, a corporate executive, or even a knowledge-sharing enthusiast, this would be a hub to gain access to a plethora of education-seeking individuals. The idea behind Scholar is to connect all educators to a platform that has students seeking help regarding tuition, assignments, or simple homework help; all via a mobile application on iOS and Android.
  

The service will have a list of features available for use. Most importantly, the ability to connect with any educator across your respective country that is qualified to teach the subject an individual is seeking help for. Using mobile application technologies, the app will allow a student to upload documents they find confusing or ones that require more thorough understanding, and discuss this with an online educator. The educator will be able to respond to the questions initiated. This will provide a platform for educators to make more money, and students to instantly connect to help; as opposed to paying for expensive tuition lessons and the hassle of organising and waiting for the tutor to have an availability. 


Furthermore, the app will be designed to support video conferencing where an educator can set-up scheduled sessions regarding specific topics whereby multiple individuals can enter the session and receive additional learning. 


Another useful feature is the ability to split questions for a student that needs to save more off this service. This may be by splitting the cost of a question two students within the same class have, to which their current teacher is not helpful enough to them, and the cost of a tutor is too expensive.


Regarding the educator, they will have been confirmed qualified for certain areas and topics of education. They will receive notifications for any direct questions sent to them, as well as general public questions that have not been directly sent. This is a time-saving and effective way for educators to earn extra money, whilst sitting at home. The ability to not commute is efficient.


With most ideas, there are flaws manifesting throughout the duration of a project. I believe a particular issue may be seen with miscommunication. The ability to hear, see and observe a physical tuition is extremely helpful; whereas the online tuition will struggle to fulfil the same effectiveness of communication. It is difficult to achieve the same level of help as the physical version.
