  Hello! My name is Jack or s3855707. I have been interested in Information technology ever since I could type on a keyboard, play on the first consoles and call on the first iPhone. All throughout high school I was building computers developing databases and studying analytics, most of this was made possible with various courses through school, one being year 8 â€“ 10 IT. My interest for IT has only developed through the years and is continuing to grow further, thanks to this course.
